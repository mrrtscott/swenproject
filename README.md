This project is in the development stage for Loan Hub

Loan Hub is a car loan information system. Its core purpose is to provide information on the different car products or packages
offered by loan instutions in Jamaica, in a compact and organised manner.The application will provide critical data needed to make
informed decisions on choosing loan products.Thereby making the loan researching process more efficient and less tedious for users.

The development of an application to fill this void will be highly beneficial to Android users who are interested in obtaining a loan.
